- New role translations live in a browser-safe shared locale module and are merged into every dictionary, so role copy and engine event tokens share the same language source.
- All lethal new-role actions use the central game death handler and defer victory until revenge prompts finish, so chained deaths preserve night/day continuation.
- Uploaded new-role portraits resolve through CDN pointer imports in roleImage; every role video lives in public/videos/roles/{id}.mp4 so the APK plays them offline.

- Engine rule tests use a separate Vitest configuration with the same source alias, keeping the app runtime plugins out of unit tests.
